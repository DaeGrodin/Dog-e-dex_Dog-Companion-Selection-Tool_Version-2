      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Dog E-dex is a basic visual introduction to dog breeds. It allows users to explore different dog breeds by looking at images,
        creating an easy way to learn about dogs.

      <h2>Why I Chose This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Many people are unfamiliar with different dog breeds. Since people tend to choose dogs often by appearance, this app
        serves as an entry point to explore a variety of dog breeds visually and determine what appeals to them.

      <h2>How It Can Be Used</h2>
      <p>
        The application is meant for casual browsing — click on a breed, view an image, and start identifying preferences. 
        It can spark curiosity and guide future research into breed temperament and care.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, I'd like to expand Dog E-dex by including more breed details — such as descriptions, temperaments, 
        and suitability for different lifestyles. This way, users can make more informed decisions.
